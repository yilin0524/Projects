Use jupyter notebook to run the P2.ipynb file.

The hn2018_2019.csv and Stopwords.txt should be in the same path with .ipynb file.
If the computer does not have the pandas, nltk, numpy, copy, matplotlib.pyplot, math, time, random and decimal librarys,
they should be downloaded firstly!!!
p.s. The plot images may not show up until the second run on jupyter.

These eight .txt files are output files.
The P2.py can run in Pycharm.


Thank you.
