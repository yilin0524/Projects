1. How to run:
1) IDE platform: VS2019
2) Run the main function in "shape_soltmachine_driver.cpp" to compile the program. And most of the code in this file is from the assignment requirements.
    There are two functions called "task1()" and "task2()" respectively implement the two tasks in the requirements. Can call different functions to test.

2. Something about this program
1) About Grid << operator overloading output is defined in the "shape_soltmachine_driver.cpp" file.
2) class slotMachine: 
	The entire running process is integrated into one function "run()".
3) This program has implemented all the functions required.

Thank you!
