The main.ipynb is the jupyter nootbook code file which implements the basic functions of this project and the bonus1.

Steps of running it on lab machine:
1) Open the anaconda prompt;
2) Input "jupyter notebook" command line
3) Creat a new folder in jupyter notebook
4) Upload the main.ipynb code file and five shape files which are crime_dt.shp, crime_dt.cpg, crime_dt.dbf, crime_dt.prj, and crime_dt.shx;
5) Run the main.ipynb;
6) Input the gridsize, such as 0.002;
7) Input the threshold, such as 75;
8) The calculation results, two path data analysis, time cost and path images will be displayed (Maybe need to run twice and the image then will show).
